This code is used for creating a web page that shows a simulation of Mars and some rockets. The code is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The HTML code defines the structure and content of the web page, such as the title, the section, the images, the canvas, and the script. The HTML code also links to the external CSS file named style.css.
The CSS code defines the style and appearance of the web page, such as the position, size, and animation of the rockets and the images. The CSS code is stored in a separate file named style.css.
The JavaScript code defines the functionality and interactivity of the web page, such as creating stars, drawing a halo and a planet, and alerting the position of the rocket. The JavaScript
code is embedded in the HTML file inside a script tag.
